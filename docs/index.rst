It is estimated that about 30% of the eucariotic proteome consists of
intrinsically disordered proteins (IDP’s), yet their presence in public
structural databases is severely underrepresented.
IDP’s adopt heterogeneous inter-converting conformations with similar
probabilities, preventing resolution of structures with X-Ray
diffraction techniques.
Small angle scattering (SAS) probes the average features of the
conformational ensemble, which can prove unsatisfactory when very different
ensembles share nearly identical average features.
To address this shortcoming, atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
combined with enhanced sampling methods such as the Hamiltonian replica
exchange method are specially suitable :cite:`Affentranger06`, since they
probe extensive regions of the IDP's free-energy phase space.
Hence, this type of simulations can produce physically meaningful
conformations and offer a full-featured description of the
conformational landscape when properly validated against available
experimental SAS data.
The python package idpflex clusters the 3D conformations resulting from
an MD simulation into a hierarchical tree, with protein substates taking
the role of tree nodes.
Alternatively, the conformational ensemble of structures can be
generated by other means than MD, such as torsional sampling of the
protein backbone :cite:`Curtis12`.
This flexibility is possible because idpflex is agnostic to the ensemble
generation method.
In contrast to other methods :cite:`Rozycki11`, idpflex does not initially
discard any conformation by labelling it as incompatible with the
available experimental data.
The data represent an average over all conformations, and using an
average as the criterion by which to discard any specific conformation
can lead to erroneous discarding decisions.
Clustering is performed according to structural similarity between
conformations, defined by the root mean square deviation
algorithm :cite:`Kabsch76`.
Alternatively, idpflex can cluster conformations according to an
Euclidean distance in the space spanned by a set of structural
properties such as radius of gyration and end-to-end distance.
Calculation of SAS intensities :cite:`Svergun95` for each substate allows
quantitative comparison to SAS data, yielding the probability of the
IDP to adopt one of the conformations of any specific substate.
Arranging tens of thousands of conformations into (typically) less than
ten substates provides the researcher with a manageable number of
macro-conformations from which to derive meaningful conclusions
regarding the conformational freedom of the IDP.
In addition to clustering, idpflex can compute structural features for
each substate such as radius of gyration, end-to-end distance,
asphericity, solvent exposed surface area, contact maps, and
secondary structure content.
All these properties require atomistic detail, thus idpflex is more
apt for the study of IDP's than for the study of quaternary protein
arrangements, where clustering of coarse-grain simulations becomes a
better option :cite:`Rozycki11`.
In summary, idpflex integrates MD simulations with SAS experiments to
obtain the conformational ensemble of IDP's, a pertinent problem in
structural biology.
